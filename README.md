# vuex-rest-api

Helper utility to simplify the usage of REST APIs with Vuex.

## Still in development
Error reports and improvement proposals are welcome!

## What is this good for
If you want to connect a REST API with Vuex you'll find that there are a few repetitive steps. You need to request the data from the api (with an action) and set the state (via a mutation). This utility helps in *creating the stores* by setting up the state, mutations and actions. It is **not** a middleware.
